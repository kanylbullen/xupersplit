    "Who is responsible (data controller)",
    <>
      Tollysplit is run by a private individual in Sweden as a non-commercial
      hobby project (the “buy me a beer” link doesn't cover its running costs).
      The data controller is{" "}

    "What data is stored & why (lawful basis)",
    <>
      Only what you enter yourself: the split's name, participant names (first
      names are plenty), expenses and transfers. Optionally, participants can
      add a payment method (Swish/Vipps/MobilePay number or IBAN, used only to
      show payment links and QR codes) and you can sign in with your email
      (entirely optional — it just makes your splits follow you across devices).
      When a split is created we also store a hashed version of your IP address
      as spam protection. The lawful basis is our legitimate interest (Art.
      6(1)(f) GDPR) in providing a simple expense-splitting tool; for sign-in,
      the email is processed to perform that service at your request.
    </>,
  ],
  [
    "For how long?",
    <>
      <strong>Payment details</strong> are wiped automatically as soon as
      everyone in the split is square. <strong>Whole splits</strong> are deleted
      automatically after 6 months of inactivity (opening a split counts as
      activity); signed-in creators can turn that purge off per split.{" "}
      <strong>The IP hash</strong> is deleted within 24 hours.
    </>,
  ],
  [
    "Who can see your data?",
    <>
      Anyone with the secret link to a split can view and edit its contents —
      that's how Tollysplit works, just like a shared notepad. Only share the
      link with the people who should be in on it. No data is sold, shared or
      used for advertising, and there is no automated decision-making or
      profiling.
    </>,
  ],
  [
    "Subprocessors & international transfers",
    <>
      Tollysplit runs on Supabase (database in Stockholm, EU), Vercel (hosting
      and anonymous, cookieless visitor statistics) and Resend (sign-in emails).
      When a Swish QR code is shown, the recipient's number, amount and the
      split's name are sent to Swish's official QR service to draw the code.
      Vercel and Resend are US-based; transfers to them rely on their EU–US Data
      Privacy Framework certification and standard contractual clauses.
    </>,

  [
    "Cookies & local storage",
    <>
      If you sign in, a session cookie is set — that's all. The “Your
      tollysplits” list, your “who are you” choice and your language/theme
      preferences are stored locally in your browser and never leave your
      device. Details are in the{" "}
